This repository contains the assignments for the Advanced Scientific Python Programming course from Uppsala University.

My final project was the datahandling jupyther notebook that prepares the data obtained from ExCAPE-DB (https://solr.ideaconsult.net/search/excape/) to train different classification models that will be employed in generative models of molecules later in my master thesis. This is a preliminary version.

My aim is to, in the next weeeks: 
1) Implement classes so I can better organize my code;
2) Work on the paralelization of my molparser() function;
3) Verify the metrics of the classifiers that were implemented; 
4) Implement more classifiers in this code and save the data of the training in an organized manner so I can later reuse them.

There's still a lot of work to be done.
